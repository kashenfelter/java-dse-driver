/**
 * A {@link SimpleModule} extension that does the necessary work to make the automatic typed deserialization
 * without full canonical class names work.
 *
 * Users of custom modules with the GraphSONMapper that want their objects to be deserialized automatically by the
 * mapper, must extend this class with their module. It is the only required step.
 *
 * Using this basis module allows the serialization and deserialization of typed objects without having the whole
 * canonical name of the serialized classes included in the Json payload. This is also necessary because Java
 * does not provide an agnostic way to search in a classpath a find a class by its simple name. Although that could
 * be done with an external library, later if we deem it necessary.
