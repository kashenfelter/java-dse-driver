# Java driver for DataStax Enterprise

This driver is based on the DataStax driver for Apache Cassandra, with specific extensions for DSE:

* [`Authenticator` implementations](manual/auth/) that use the authentication scheme negotiation in the server-side
  `DseAuthenticator`;
* value classes for [geospatial types](manual/geo_types/), and type codecs that integrate them seamlessly with the
  driver;
* [DSE graph integration](manual/graph/).

*The Java DataStax Enterprise Driver can be used solely with DataStax Enterprise. Please consult
[the license](#license).*
